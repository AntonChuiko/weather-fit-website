        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p class="marginb-20">By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should
          make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify
          the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
          source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
          derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
          intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Anton Chuiko.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">Anton Chuiko is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.
          For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
          and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you
          exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">The Weather Fit app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in
          order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
          therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
          restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
          vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
          that the Weather Fit app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank">AdMob</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/legal/tos" target="_blank">Mapbox</a>
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="marginb-20">You should be aware that there are certain things that Anton Chuiko will not take
          responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
          The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Anton Chuiko cannot take
          responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
          have any of your data allowance left.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms
          of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
          mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other
          third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
          data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off
          data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that
          we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">Along the same lines, Anton Chuiko cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
          the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t
          turn it on to avail the Service, Anton Chuiko cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">With respect to Anton Chuiko’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using
          the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at
          all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
          Anton Chuiko accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
          wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the
          requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may
          change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Anton Chuiko does not
          promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version
          that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
          offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without
          giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
          licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
          from your device.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">
        <h2>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2>
        </p>
        <p class="marginb-20">I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
          this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
          Conditions on this page.</p>
        <p class="marginb-20">These terms and conditions are effective as of August 28, 2021.</p>
